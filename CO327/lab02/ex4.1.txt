mkfifo(fifo, 0666);

This creates a file on given directory, if there isn't exists it already.
Here, 0666 is a decimal based notation for file permissions. This creates a file with permission 0666
0666 means the file can be read and write by user, group or any user.
(Equals to ugo+rw or rw-rw-rw)

If we didn't use this command, the file should be created by manually.
Unless it gives garbage values for reading and writing doesn't make any mean. We can't determine how OS handles with this file.
